## Smart City (My Problem) Simulation

I would derive a mathematical function to get an analytical solution. 

Clinical standards exsist for staff to patient ratios. 

Once each variable (staff) are assigned a value according to the standards, we can calculate the maximum number of patients that can be received based on the number of staff on shift.

Delays at the hospital greatly impacts the EMS' ability to continue processing the injured.
